# PRD Review Checklist

## Instructions

This checklist should be completed during **Plan Mode** after creating or updating the PRD. Use this to ensure the PRD meets quality standards before proceeding to architecture design.

**How to use:**
- Review each item carefully
- Mark [x] for items that are satisfactory
- Mark [ ] for items that need attention
- Add comments where clarification is needed
